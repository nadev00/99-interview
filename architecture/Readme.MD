# Live Leaderboard System

## **Proposed Technologies**

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth 2.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Live Updates**: WebSockets
- **Cache Layer**: Redis

## **How It Works**

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user interacts with the frontend UI. For example, when they click on a specific action, the system dispatches an event to the backend via an API endpoint such as `/interact` (POST).

2. **Database Update**:
   - The backend processes the event and updates the database with the new score. After the update, the backend fetches the top 10 users' scores from the database, caches the leaderboard in Redis, and emits a `leaderboard-update` event to the frontend via WebSockets.

3. **Initial Connection**:
   - When a user visits the website for the first time, a connection event is triggered. The backend retrieves the current leaderboard data from the cache and sends it to the frontend.

4. **Authentication**:
   - **JWT**: Used for authentication to ensure secure API requests.
   - **OAuth 2.0**: While more complex, it can be implemented if integration with external providers (e.g., Facebook, Google) is desired.

5. **Authorization**:
   - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Define roles for all users and assign permissions based on roles.
   - **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: More flexible, allowing users to perform actions based on specific attributes of a page.

## **Why Not Kafka?**

For a lightweight system like a scoreboard, using Kafka might be overkill unless the application needs to handle extremely high traffic or perform complex event processing. The proposed architecture is sufficient for a typical use case.

## **Development and Deployment**

### **Backend**
- Use **EC2 instances** for hosting the backend.
- Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- Automate deployment using **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**, triggered by changes to specific branches.

### **Frontend**
- Build the React application and host the static files in an **S3 bucket**.
- Use **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** to serve the frontend globally and efficiently.
- This approach is cost-effective while ensuring performance.

## **Scalability**
- For advanced scalability and reliability, technologies like Kubernetes (K8S) can be considered. However, for this project, simpler deployment strategies suffice.

This setup provides a robust and cost-effective solution for implementing a real-time leaderboard system while keeping the architecture simple and efficient.
